Second analysis project.
Challenge to make up random analysis questions and solve them by the end of this week.
I'll be incorporating everything I've learned in the short period of time ive been learning data analysis and visualisation with python.
I'm using pandas mainly and hoping to use other libraries in the future for further analysis and updates.
The students_perfomance_analysis.csv file was obtained from kaggle.com. It has exactly 1000 rows and 8 columns.
